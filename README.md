# humanReadableRegs
Project to brainstorm a new way of writing and editing AFIs

theory: the way we write regs already matches the way git files are handled. A central authority approves changes and publishes and anyone can contribute. Since many regs are already available on af epubs there should be no restrictions from transferring them to an open git repo.

benefits: defining a standard file type could reduce the workload on all levels by automatically formatting regulations and managing how sub commands post supplements to the parent regulations. No longer would sups ignore the reg of regs and be posted separate from the parent reg...i'm looking at you 55OG sups.

Entire regulation history could be easily accessible for all members, this would be useful when trying to decipher ambiguous language.

No more 847's. Git provides the whole process for offering and accepting or rejecting changes with comments. We would leverage an open source system to provide all users a better experience without additional costs.
